This repo is for my Codédex progress. You can [join Codédex here](https://www.codedex.io/home) if you wish to learn too.

My aim is to complete at least a little bit every day. The files I have uploaded to this repo are purely for me to document my learning and what I have done through my Codédex journey. It may not be best practice or the best code, and if you have any feedback I'd be happy to hear it!

‼️ Disclaimer, I would not look through the code if you are also learning, as these examples are my answers to the lessons on Codédex!
